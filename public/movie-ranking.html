<h1>The best movies according to Anthony</h1>
<h2> My best three movies of all times</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>It makes me think on how complex life could be, but at the same time how simply you can live it.</p>
<h3>Fight club</h3>
<p> it could seem a youth movie but actually let you think about averything you use to see "nomrally".</p>
<h3>Requiem fro a dream</h3>
<p>Actually it's one of the movies I like the less. Too real, everyone should look at it and maybe they could understand difficulties of addicted people.</p>
